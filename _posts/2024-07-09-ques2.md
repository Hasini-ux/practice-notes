```
Both for and while loops are used to repeat a block of code, but they differ in their structure and when you might use them.

A for loop is typically used when you know how many times you want to iterate. It has three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.

for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement)
{
    // code to be executed
}
A while loop, on the other hand, is used when you want to continue looping as long as a certain condition is true. It only has one part: the condition.

while (condition)
{
    // code to be executed
}
In a while loop, you have to manage the loop variable manually, meaning you have to initialize it before the loop and increment/decrement it inside the loop. In a for loop, all of this is done in the loop statement itself.
