```
A for loop is a control flow statement in programming that allows code to be executed repeatedly. A for loop has three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement. Here's a basic structure of a for loop:

for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement)
{
    // code to be executed
}
Initialization: Here, we initialize the loop counter to a starting value.

Condition: This is a boolean expression that the program checks before each iteration. If it's true, the loop continues; if it's false, the loop ends.

Increment/Decrement: This changes the loop counter in some way during each iteration.
